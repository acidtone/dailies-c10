# Follow the White Rabbit
This is a command line exercise for practicing [basic file system navigation commands](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/316d2bd9cf59f841684dbd68ffc3ee95):
- `pwd`: Display your present (working) directory
- `ls`: List directory contents
- `cd`: Change directory

## Instructions
1. Download/Clone/Copy this folder to your workspace.
2. Navigate to this directory using your terminal.
    - Note: when you open a new terminal window (i.e. using _Git Bash_ on Windows or _Terminal_ on Mac OS) the default location will normally be your home folder (`/Users/jane`).
3. Somewhere in this directory is an image of a White Rabbit. Find it using only the command line.

## Extra Activities
Find the rabbit? Try these challenges next:
- Create a new directory with the `mkdir` command;
- Copy an animal to another location in `animal-world` using the `cp` command;
- Rescue (move) the Tiger from the zoo using the `mv` command;
- The clearing in the forest is so beautiful, it needs a file to describe it:
    1. Navigate to the `clearing`;
    2. In the clearing, create an empty `README.md` file using the `touch` command;
    3. Using VS Code, open `README.md` and write a poetic description of the clearing, OR:
        - Advanced: write a poetic description of the clearing in `README.md` directly from the terminal using `vi` or `vim`.
- Open an image from the command line (you might need to search for some hints on this one).
